# Readability.Lib

Readability.Lib is our project that we defined as a New Generation Accessible Library. Its aim is to engage the new generation with reading stories, catering to their preference for fast consumption. Our story formats are designed to be read in 1-2 minutes, each accompanied by a specific image. The project utilizes Gemini, OpenAI, and our finetuned simple AI model, Ozi. For images, we use Hugging Face's text-to-image model, and for accessibility, we leverage Google Cloud's Text-to-Speech and Speech-to-Text APIs.

## Features

- **Short Stories**: Quick 1-2 minute stories to capture the attention of the fast-consuming new generation.
- **Images**: Each story is paired with a specific image generated using Hugging Face text-to-image models.
- **Advanced AI**: Utilizes Gemini, OpenAI, and our finetuned AI model Ozi.
- **Accessibility**: Google Cloud Text-to-Speech and Speech-to-Text APIs ensure accessibility for all users.
## Interactive Stories

Thanks to the advanced AI model Gemini 1.5 Pro, we can provide instructions that make you a player in the story. We employ methods for history management using SQLite3, among other technologies. Additionally, users will be able to share their stories in a forum, which is planned to enhance creativity and provide a lively environment for story lovers.


## User Authentication System

We have a robust user authentication system that ensures security and reliability. Key features include:

- **Encrypted Passwords**: User passwords are stored in an encrypted format to protect user data.
- **Email Verification**: An email verification process is mandatory for all users, utilizing OTP (One-Time Password) for added security.
